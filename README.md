# Hello there! I’m **Aditya Vaish** 👨🏻‍💻
I’m an open source dev who loves contributing to cool repos  sometimes fixing bugs, sometimes *creating exciting new ones by accident*. It’s all part of being a good coder <br><br>I'm majorly a **Python Developer**, but I occasionally wander into other tech stacks like a curious engineer pressing buttons to see what happens  and somehow, things still work.<br><br>From **DevOps to Agentic A.I workflows**, I love to get my hands on every new emerging and hot tech.<br>
